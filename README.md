=================

Learning snippets for compilers, interpreters, code generation, virtual machines, assemblers, JITs, etc.

Stuff that may be interesting:

- fp/secd: implementation of SECD virtual machine in C with a Scheme-to-SECD compiler.
- x86/hasm: a simple x86 assembler written in Haskell, now it's opcode set is very limited (mov/add/pop/ret).
- llvm/kldscp: LLVM tutorial, JIT compiler of a toy language Kaleidoscope.
